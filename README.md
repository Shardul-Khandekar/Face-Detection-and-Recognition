# Face-Detection-and-Recognition
This uses dlib and face-recognition libraries to detect and encode a 128d face vector. This extracted features are now used to recognize faces in the image or video. This method only uses a single image to extract features.
The FaceDetect file is used to recognize faces in the image while EncodeRecognize uses OpenCV to capture video through webcam and recognize faces.
